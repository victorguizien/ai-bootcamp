# DataAnalystAgent

A lightweight orchestration layer that chains two existing LangGraph projects into a single pipeline:

1. **`data-cleaning-agent`**: LLM-driven data cleaning
2. **`eda-workflow`**: automated first-pass exploratory data analysis

Flow: **raw CSV → PII guardrail → clean data → EDA report**

## Why this project exists

`DataAnalystAgent` demonstrates agent-to-agent orchestration without rewriting either sub-project. The parent graph handles state passing, input guardrails (PII detection), and conditional routing (e.g. blocking the pipeline when PII is found, or skipping EDA when cleaning fails).

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Poetry
- OpenAI API key

### Install
From this folder:

```bash
poetry install
```

Copy the example environment file and fill in your key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

## Run example

```bash
poetry run python example_usage.py
```

- **`orchestrator_reference.py`** — Complete solution for reference.
- **`guardrails.py`** — PII column detection guardrail.

## Graph visualization

Running `example_usage.py` generates a `graph.png` diagram of the orchestration graph.

## LangSmith (optional)

To enable tracing, set the LangSmith variables in your `.env` file. If they are not set, the pipeline runs normally without tracing.

## Notes
- Both sub-projects (`data-cleaning-agent` and `eda-workflow`) are linked as **local path dependencies** in `pyproject.toml`. This means they are expected to live in sibling directories (e.g. `../data-cleaning-agent` and `../eda-workflow`). When you run `poetry install`, Poetry resolves them from those local paths rather than from PyPI.
- A PII guardrail runs before any LLM call and blocks the pipeline if sensitive columns are detected.
- If cleaning fails, EDA is skipped.
